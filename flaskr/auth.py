"""A view function is the code you write to respond to requests to your application. 
Flask uses patterns to match the incoming request URL to the view that should handle it. 
The view returns data that Flask turns into an outgoing response. Flask can also go the 
other direction and generate a URL to a view based on its name and arguments.

A Blueprint is a way to organize a group of related views and other code. Rather than
registering views and other code directly with an application, they are registered with 
a blueprint. Then the blueprint is registered with the application when it is available 
in the factory function.
